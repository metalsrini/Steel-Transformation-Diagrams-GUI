# Theoretical Background

## Phase Transformations in Steel

### Austenite Transformation
Austenite (γ-Fe) is the high-temperature phase of iron and steel, with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. During cooling, austenite can transform into several different phases:

1. **Ferrite (α-Fe)**
   - Body-centered cubic (BCC) structure
   - Soft and ductile phase
   - Forms at higher temperatures during slow cooling
   - Nucleates preferentially at grain boundaries

2. **Pearlite**
   - Lamellar structure of ferrite and cementite
   - Forms at intermediate temperatures
   - Diffusion-controlled transformation
   - Properties depend on lamellar spacing

3. **Bainite**
   - Forms at lower temperatures than pearlite
   - Mixture of ferrite and carbides
   - Semi-diffusional transformation
   - Upper and lower bainite variants

4. **Martensite**
   - Body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure
   - Forms by rapid cooling (quenching)
   - Diffusionless transformation
   - High hardness and strength

## Critical Temperatures

### Ae3 Temperature
- Upper critical temperature
- Above this temperature, steel is fully austenitic
- Influenced by carbon content and alloying elements
- Calculated using empirical formulas considering chemical composition

### Ae1 Temperature
- Lower critical temperature
- Eutectoid temperature (727°C for plain carbon steel)
- Below this temperature, no austenite can exist at equilibrium
- Less sensitive to alloying elements than Ae3

### Bs Temperature (Bainite Start)
- Temperature where bainite formation begins
- Strongly influenced by alloying elements
- Typically between 550°C and 400°C
- Calculated using composition-dependent equations

### Ms Temperature (Martensite Start)
- Temperature where martensite formation begins
- Continues until Mf (Martensite finish) temperature
- Highly dependent on carbon content
- Other alloying elements also affect Ms

## Transformation Diagrams

### TTT (Time-Temperature-Transformation) Diagrams
- Also known as isothermal transformation diagrams
- Shows transformation kinetics at constant temperature
- C-shaped curves due to competing factors:
  1. Diffusion rate (increases with temperature)
  2. Driving force (increases with undercooling)
- Used for:
  - Understanding transformation mechanisms
  - Designing heat treatments
  - Predicting microstructures

### CCT (Continuous-Cooling-Transformation) Diagrams
- Represents transformations during continuous cooling
- More practical for industrial applications
- Features:
  - Curved transformation lines
  - Cooling rate dependent
  - Multiple phases possible
- Applications:
  - Heat treatment design
  - Welding process optimization
  - Predicting as-cooled properties

## Effects of Alloying Elements

### Carbon (C)
- Most influential element
- Increases hardenability
- Lowers Ms temperature
- Strengthens ferrite
- Promotes carbide formation

### Manganese (Mn)
- Increases hardenability
- Lowers transformation temperatures
- Strengthens ferrite
- Promotes austenite stability

### Chromium (Cr)
- Carbide former
- Increases hardenability
- Improves corrosion resistance
- Raises critical temperatures

### Nickel (Ni)
- Austenite stabilizer
- Improves toughness
- Lowers transformation temperatures
- Does not form carbides

### Molybdenum (Mo)
- Strong carbide former
- Significantly increases hardenability
- Reduces temper embrittlement
- Improves high-temperature strength

## Hardness Prediction

### Factors Affecting Hardness
1. Carbon content
2. Alloying elements
3. Cooling rate
4. Prior austenite grain size
5. Final microstructure

### Calculation Methods
- Based on chemical composition
- Considers cooling rate effects
- Accounts for mixed microstructures
- Uses empirical relationships
